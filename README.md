# UFOInfo
MVP: A multi page website with a navbar and sourced information about UFOS. First page is about locations (pick a state, it shows the most common UFO shape recorded from that state), the second page is about the trend of reported sightings on a graph (sightings vs time). On each page has 1-2 drop down options for the user to click on a specific piece of information about UFOs. The website has a green color scheme and overall looks professional.
Extra features: More click-able features for users to try offering more specific information about UFOS. A clickable UFO fun fact on each page!

It's important to note that the sightings this dataset uses are self-reported, and although the creator Sigmond Axel tried to clean up most of the reports, the sightings' information could be muddled or inaccurate.
Here's a link to Axel's write up on this process: https://github.com/planetsig/ufo-reports
